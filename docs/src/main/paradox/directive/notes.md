## Reveal.js Speaker Notes

Reveal.js comes with a [Speaker Notes](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes) plugin which can be used to present per-slide notes in a separate browser window. The notes window also gives you a preview of the next upcoming slide so it may be helpful even if you haven't written any notes.
Press the **s** key on your keyboard to open the notes window.
